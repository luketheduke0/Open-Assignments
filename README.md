As a poor college student, one of the worst things about college was being forced to pay for and complete class- and book-specific assignments online. This often required the purchase of a $100+ access code on top of a $200+ book. It just made me feel like I was being exploited completely by the publishers. My disdain for such treatment has prompted me to begin work on Open Assignments.
The idea of Open Assignments is to make an open-source web application built for making and tracking online assignments for students that 1. is easy enough to install that a teacher could do it, and 2. is extensible enough that it can be used by an entire school.
